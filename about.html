			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p><em>Much of the work I do is for large companies whose names I'm contractually obligated not to disclose. Sadly, this makes bragging about my work rather difficult, but we should get together and talk about <strong>what</strong> I've done, and dance around exactly <strong>who</strong> it was done for. If you'd like to learn more about the work I've done, check out my <a href="resume.html">resume</a>.</em></p>

			<h3>Getting to know me. Getting to know all about me.</h3>
			<p>In the 5th grade we learned how to build Powerpoint presentations. My first was about bees(i think), and on the first page I put buttons that took you to the various informational slides within. Forget going sequencially, I was able to skip to the section I wanted from the very beginning. I consider that my first "website", and I really enjoyed being able to build something that provided information in such an organized way.</p>

			<p>Then my parents got us dialup internet at home. It was AOL, and it was the greatest thing imaginable. Immediately, I fell in love with the idea of being able to publish a website, and have it be available to anyone in the world with an Internet connection. I started out building a few websites with Yahooâ€™s Geocities, and knew right away that I needed to take a more proactive approach if I was to build the kinds of websites that inspired me in the first place. I purchased a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Everything-HTML-James-Pence/dp/0072132736">How to do everything with HTML</a> and began building web sites the legitimate way. The book taught me table-based design, but once I started digging through the source code of other websites I noticed people were using something called CSS. Sure enough, after a few months of learning CSS I needed to make my pages more interactive, so started writing JavaScript. That was a big turning point for me, because JavaScript really allowed my logic-driven mind to run rampant.I also really enjoyed the flexibility the JavaScript allowed. It inspired me to start exploring programming concepts, and eventually other languages. At this point I saw value in learning a server-side language, so PHP was the natural choice. Learning PHP, along with MySQL, allowed me to see just how powerful a website could be when you leverage the proper tools. I now had complete control of both the front and back end portions of the website. After building a few database driven sites, I  wanted to keep pushing my abilities on the front end also, so I picked up a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Teach-Yourself-Macromedia-Flash-Yourself/dp/0672323710">Learn Macromedia Flash in 24 Hours</a> book and set to it. It took way longer than 24 hours to get the hang of it. My passion for both logic and design quickly made this my favorite program. I could build advanced animations by using the timeline, but as I got my feet wet in Actionscript, I knew that I could develop some amazing things with this program too.</p>

			<p>Time passed, and I decided I wanted to do build web things for a living. Do what you love, and you never work a day of your life. It also helped that getting into this industry was a relatively safe bet. I went to the Illinois Institute of Art - Chicago, and got a Bachelors of Fine Arts in Web Design and Interactive Media, graduating with Honors. Most of the assignments there were design-oriented, which meant that I needed to keep up to pace with development trends on my own. Ruby on Rails was taking off during this time, and it seemed like a good replacement for the mess of PHP I had been swimming in. I read through most of <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/media/poignant-guide.pdf" target="_blank">Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby</a> before I started losing my mind and decided to start building little practice applications. At first, they were all pretty pointless and poorly written, but progressed nicely as I learned the best practices. That approach summurizes how I like to work, and its a very pragmatic approach. I hack something together, break it , and refactor it. Then I iterate endlessly on that process. I like to learn by doing, and best practices are only best practices until they aren't, so I try not to get too bogged down in them from the very start. Slowly patterns will emerge from whatever I'm writing, and then it's time to refactor.</p>

			<p>The end-game for me is to work as a consultant. I would love to be able to swoop into broken project teams, and help them sort themselves out. It will be frustrating and demanding, certainly, but I really think it will be rewarding. I like working with people and providing them with solutions. I've found that by being honest and open with my thoughts, I can earn people's trust so that we can shake things up to get them out of whatever rut their in. Pushing for change can be a real challenge for people who are deeply engrained in their own way of doing things, but it's nessesary, and building trust is the only way to get there.</p>
